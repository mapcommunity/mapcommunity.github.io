<h3>Organization Committee (Diaz-Toca G., Rubio J.)</h3>

<p>
The 2006 map meeting was held from January 9th (monday) to January
13th (friday), 2006, in Castro Urdiales, Spain.
</p>

<p> Lodging and meals took place at the hotel <a
href="http://www.lasrocashotel.com/en/">Las Rocas</a>.
</p>

<p>
In this edition the organization of MAP was sligthly
different to the three previous years. Mornings were
devoted to invited talks and tutorials. So, the number
of contributed talks decreased considerably with
respect to previous MAPs. As a consequence, the selection process was
more strict. The Scientific Committee tried to
keep a trade-off among the different areas with representation
in the MAP community. Please, don't consider a non acceptation
as a critic to the quality of your work: it is an issue more
related to the balance of topics.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, the number of participants in this edition was equivalent
to previous MAPs. You were all welcome.
</p>

<p>
The invited speakers were:
<ul>
     <li>Deepak Kapur</li>
     <li>Bruno Buchberger</li>
     <li>Jose Luis Ruiz-Reina</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, four tutorials were held:
<ul>
     <li> Albat Quadrat (Control Theory)</li>
     <li> Francis Sergeraert (Constructive Algebraic Topology)</li>
     <li> Ulrich Kohlenbach (Proof Mining)</li>
     <li> Thierry Coquand (Type Theory)</li>

		<a class="lititle" href="castro/slides/briseid/MAP2006.pdf">Proof mining and fixed points of generalized
			p-contractive mappings on metric spaces</a><p>
		<p class="abstract">
		We present quantitative versions of some fixed point theorems for contractive type mappings on metric
		 spaces. These are derived with the help of insights and techniques from proof mining. In one case our version is also a qualitative improvement 			compared to known theorems.</p>

		<p class="abstract">
		Title:  Symbolic Computation: Self-application of Algorithmic Mathematics
		Author: Bruno Buchberger

		Abstract:

		We explain our view that mathematics, in some sense, is essentially symbolic computation. 
		In recent years, with the advent of modern computer technology, this view becomes more and more 
		concrete: Mathematics is always pursued, at the same time, at the object level (exploring mathematical theories) 
		and on the meta-level (observing how theory exploration can be systematized and, maybe, made algorithmic).  
		In the talk we give four examples of techniques used in current systems, like Theorema, for the automation
		of mathematical theory exploration: computation and proving within the same logic system; the reduction of 
		logical proving to solving in algebraic domains; the use of formula schemes for the invention of definitions, 
		propositions, problems, and algorithms;  and the automated generation of conjectures  from failing proofs. 
		We finally draw some conclusions about how such systems will change the way how we do mathematical research, 
		how we review, assess, store, and retrieve mathematical knowledge, how we teach, and how we apply mathematics.</p>

	<li>Gema M. Diaz-Toca and Henri Lombardi 
		<p>Dynamic Galois theory and Splitting Fields</p>
		<p>
		Our main aim with this talk is to introduce a dynamic constructive Galois Theory which
		allows us to obtain a representation of the splitting field of a separable polynomial over a field. 
		We present some methods which are giving a constructive substitute for the classical 
		splitting field, which does not work when there is no factorization algorithm. 
		With our methodology, we're trying to combine the dynamic evaluation
		techniques (D5) introduced by Della Dora, Dicrescenzo and Duval with the fantastic Galois theory.

		Three different approaches for automatically generating
		polynomial relations as loop invariants are
		presented.  A method based on quantifier-elimination seems
		particularly promising since it works for programs with nested
		loops and procedure calls, as well as it admits numerous
		heuristics; the use of an incomplete method for
		quantifier-elimination does not produce an incorrect invariant
		but rather, a weak invariant.  The other two approaches use
		ideal-theoretic semantics of simple programming language
		constructs. Polynomial invariants form an ideal which (or its
		approximations) can be computed using algebraic geometry tools.
		The approaches are illustrated using a variety of examples.  The
		critical role of algebraic geometry in discovering these results
		is discussed. It is proposed that equally rich theories about
		other data structures will have to be developed in order to make
		progress in automatically generating program invariants expressed
		in terms of properties of such data structures.

		<p>
		In recent years (though influenced by papers of G. Kreisel going back

		an applied form of proof theory systematically evolved which sometimes 
		is called `Proof Mining'. 
		A particularly fruitful area of applications of proof theory in mathematics

		<p>(Joint work with David Delahaye)<br>

		We propose a decision procedure for algebraically closed fields based on a
		quantifier elimination method. The procedure is intended to build proofs for
		systems of polynomial equations and inequations. We describe how this
		procedure can be carried out in a proof assistant using a Computer Algebra 
		system in a purely skeptical way. We present an implementation in the 
		particular framework of Coq and Maple giving some details regarding the

		In this conference we present our experience using the ACL2 system to verify
		computer algebra. First we give a short introduction to the formal
		verification of programs and the use of theorem provers as a tool for this
		task. Then, we present a short overview to the ACL2 system, used by our
		reserch group in Seville to carry out formal verification, and we try to
		motivate why we think it is suitable for formal verification of symbolic

		<a href="castro/slides/schuster/castro.pdf">Problems as Solution</a>
		<p class="abstract">
		It is folklore that if a continuous equation has approximate solutions
		and - in a quantitative manner - at most one solution, then it has a
		(of course, uniquely determined) exact solution. I first review the
		standard ways to validate this heuristic principle both in classical
		mathematics and in constructive mathematics with countable choice, and
		then indicate how this can be carried over to the choice-free way of
		doing completions put forward by Mulvey, Stolzenberg, Richman, et
		al. Moreover, I sketch how the crucial "at most one" hypothesis can be
		obtained, by invoking Brouwer's fan theorem, from appropriate preconditions 
		of a qualitative nature. In fact, the fan theorem is equivalent to the 
		general validity of the implication from the qualitative to the quantitative 
		uniqueness condition for continuous functions on a compact metric space.

		Abstract: We formalize the standard proof (using computability

		Abstracts of F. Sergeraert's Castro-Urdiales talks.
		<br>
		A tutorial about "Constructive Algegraic Topology" was required.
		The subject has been naturally divided into four parts.
		<br>
		Castro-1: Combinatorial  Topology.  The standard  simplicial complexes
		  are not enough for good algebraic topology, the so-called simplicial
		  *sets* are necessary. Castro-1  is an expository presentation of the
		  subject with the simplest examples. For serious references, question
		  Google  with  "Peter May  simplicial  objects"  and "Goerss  Jardine
		  simplicial theory".
		<br>
		Castro-2.   Homological  algebra.  Devoted  to  *one* typical  example
		  explaining why  standard homological algebra is  not effective.  The
		  best  reference  for  elementary  homological  algebra  probably  is
		  MacLane, "Homological Algebra".  The talk terminates with the subtle
		  definitions of effective chain complexes and locally effective chain
		  complexes.
		<br>
		Castro-3. Effective  homology. Combining the notions  of effective and
		  locally   effective  chain  complexes,   and  the   so-called  Basic
		  Perturbation Lemma,  an easy and efficient solution  is obtained for
		  Constructive Algebraic topology. The simple example of the effective
		  homology version of  the Serre spectral sequence is  used.  See also
		  Google(Rubio  Sergeraert  Bulletin)  in  which  other  more  precise
		  references can be obtained.
		<br>
		Castro-4.   An  informal exposition  about  the  hard but  interesting
		  problems  which are met  when the  theoretical methods  of effective
		  homology  are to  be  *concretely* implemented  on  a computer.  The
		  programming  context is  quite new  and leads  to  numerous exciting
		  problems.

	Title: Diagrammatic Specifications of Symbolic Computation Systems
	<br>
	Authors: C. Domínguez, D. Duval, L. Lambán and J. Rubio
	<br>
	Abstract
	<br>
	The aim of this work is to describe the current state of an ongoing
	project to formalize, within the framework of diagrammatic logic
	(due to Dominique Duval and Christian Lair) some data structures
	appearing in Sergeraert's symbolic computation systems Kenzo and
	EAT. In a previous work, we gave some hints on the reason why a
	key construction (called imp construction) in the specification
	of the systems can be understood as a freely generating functor
	between suitable categories of diagrammatic realizations. Now, we
	will focus on the new  open lines, giving a few details on the
	problems we have encountered up to now.

	<p>
	Symbolic Computation of A_\infty-structures:
	(Abstract)

	In the framework of Effective Algebraic Topology, we are interested in the computation 
	of A-infinity structures.

	In this poster, we would like to show wich type of pitfalls we had to solve.

	Thanks to the basic perturbation lemma and the tensor trick, from theorical 
	viewpoint it is possible to obtain the morphisms involved in such structures 
	 with the help of a computer.

	But the problems appear when we translate this mathematical notion to computational world. 

	For short, only two specific problems are explained in this poster: how to solve infinite loops and 
	the extension of class family!

	<li>L. Marin <a href="castro/slides/marin/lmarin.pdf">Computing morphisms between modules over
		nonunital rings using patterns in graphs</a><p>
	<p>

	When we study the structure of nonunital rings, they appear some categories
	of modules over them, one of those is the category of firm modules, i.e.
	modules $M$ such that the multiplication $R \otimes_R M \to M$ is an isomorphism. 
	The ring itself uses not to be firm, but there is always a special family of firm
	modules that generates all the others. Those special modules are built from
	infinite graphs that describe the module structure.

	Similar patterns in different graphs generate module homomorphisms. Those
	are the only possible morphisms in some important cases. In order to
	represent those infinite graphs on a computer, we also need that some basic
	patterns are repeated. This family is dense and very useful in order to
	compute morphisms. We represent them and give an algorithm which says
	when two of such graphs represent isomorphic modules.

	<p>
	Spectral Sequences are a useful tool in Algebraic Topology providing information on homology 
	groups by successive approximations from the homology of appropriate associated complexes. However, 
	they are not real algorithms except in exceptional cases. On the contrary, the effective homology 
	method provides a real algorithm for the computation of homology groups of complicated spaces. In 
	this poster, we explain how the effective homology method can also be used for the computation of 
	spectral sequences. A set of programs has been developed, allowing the user to calculate the whole 
	set of components of spectral sequences associated to filtered complexes.
