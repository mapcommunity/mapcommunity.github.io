
<p>These lectures  will cover a  wide range of topics  in constructive
real  and functional  analysis; they  will be  based primarily  on the
reference [1].   Beginning with  a brief introduction  to constructive
thinking  and  informal  intuitionistic   logic,  I  will  present  an
interval-arithmetic development  of the real line,  together with some
basic real analysis. We will then deal with the constructive theory of
metric,  normed,  and  Hilbert  spaces.   This will  lead  us  to  the
separation and Hahn-Banach theorems, which will be use to characterise
linear  functionals on  the dual  space and  on the  space  of bounded
operators on a  Hilbert space.  The final part  of the analysis proper
will  deal with  the existence  of adjoints,  locating the  kernel and
range  of  an  operator,   and  applications  of  Baire’s  theorem  in
functional analysis.  If  time permits, I will discuss  recent work on
the role  of Brouwer’s fan theorem  in analysis, part of  a project on
constructive reverse mathematics.</p>
