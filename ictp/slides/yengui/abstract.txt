
<p>In my course  I will try to approach  constructively the problem of
projective  modules   over  polynomial  rings   originally  raised  by
J.-P. Serre in 1955.</p>

<p>Serre remarked that  it was not known whether  there exist finitely
generated projective  modules over multivariate  polynomial rings with
coeffcients in  a field, which are  not free. This  remark turned into
the  "Serre's conjecture"  or "Serre's  problem", stating  that indeed
there were no  such modules.  Proven independently by  D.  Quillen and
A.   A.   Suslin  in  1976,   it  became  subsequently  known  as  the
Quillen-Suslin theorem.  In my  course I will give constructive proofs
of Quillen  and Suslin proofs  of Serre's conjecture, simple  and con-
structive  proofs of  some subsequent  developments in  the  theory of
projective modules over  polynomial rings, and also I  will cast light
on a new  progress very recently obtained concerning  the Hermite ring
Conjecture.</p>

<p>My course will be divided into four parts.</p>

<p>1. Constructive  theory of  projective modules, Quillen's  proof of
Serre's  conjecture,  notably  Quillen's patching  theorem,  Horrocks'
theorem, Quillen's induction theorem.</p>

<p>2.  Suslin's proof  of  Serre's conjecture,  a  general method  for
making  the  use  of  maximal  ideals  constructive,  the  theorem  of
Traverso-Swan- Coquand about seminormality.</p>

<p>3. Constructive theory of arithmetical rings, constructive compari-
son  between  the   rings  R(X)  and  R<X>  and   application  to  the
Lequain-Simis   induction  theorem,  a   constructive  proof   of  the
Lequain-Simis-Vasconcelos theorem asserting  that for any arithmetical
ring  R, all  finitely generated  projective  R[X1,...,Xn]-modules are
extended from R.</p>

<p>4. A  new progress concerning  the long-standing Hermite  ring Con-
jecture (1972)  asserting that if R  is an Hermite ring  (that is, all
finitely generated stably free R-modules are free) then so is R[X]. Of
course, a positive  solution to this conjecture will  imply a positive
solution to the famous  Bass-Quillen Conjecture (1976) saying that for
any  local   regular  ring   R,  all  finitely   generated  projective
R[X]-modules  are free. We  will prove  (constructively) that  for any
ring R  with Krull dimension <  2, R[X] is an  Hermite ring. Moreover,
the  corresponding completion  of unimodular  rows can  be  done using
elementary matrices (instead of  invertible matrices). In other words,
we will prove that for any ring R  with Krull dimension < 2 and n > 2,
any unimodular  vector in R[X]^n  can be completed into  an elementary
matrice in  R[X]^(nxn). We will also  discuss possible generalizations
of this result and some new open questions that it raises.</p>
