
<p>  Macaulay  introducing  the  notion of  inverse  systems  proposed
duality  as a strong  combinatorial tool  for performing  ideal theory
investigation.    This   series  of   lectures   surveys  the   recent
combinatorial algorithmical results  stemmed from Macaulay's ideas and
the  description  they  offer  on  the structure  of  a  0-dimensional
ideal:</p>

<p>1. Moeller Algorthm and variations (FGLM, Fitzpatrick).</p>

<p>  The algorithm applies  elementary linear  algebra to  solve, with
good  complexity,  the  following  problem:  given  a  finite  set  of
functionals which defines a  0-dim.  ideal, return its Groebner basis.
The  main applications  are point  evaluation, computing  lex Groebner
bases (FGLM), decoding BCM codes (Fitzpatrick).</p>

<p>2. Cerlienco-Mureddu  Algorithm, Lazard Theorem, Gianni--Kalkbrener
Theorem.</p>

<p> The lecture gives a survey on the main results which shed light on
the  combinatorial structure  of (radical)  0-dimensional  ideals. The
lecture gives also a guideline  to the readings required by the fourth
lecture.</p>

<p>3. Lasker--Noether Decomposition and Macaulay's Algorithm.</p>

<p> Lasker--Noether First Theorem states that each ideal is decomposed
into  irreducible  components  and  a lemma  proves  that  irreducible
components  are  primaries.    Lasker--Noether  Second  Theorem  packs
together the irreducible components  associated to a specific prime in
order to produce a  decomposition into primaries notwithstanding that,
when the theorem was stated,  there was already an explicit procedure,
given by Macaualy, which allowed to compute the irreducible components
of any  given primary. The aim of  this lecture is to  explain why the
notion   of   irreducible   decomposition   has  been   removed   from
booktexts.</p>

<p>4. Variations on point interpolation.</p>

<p> The students are required to read the suggested papers and to test
the   corresponding   algorithms  on   some   easy  and   illuminating
examples. The aim of the last  lecture is a common discussion on these
algorithms and on their practicability.</p>
