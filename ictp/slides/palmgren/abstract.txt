
<p> Locale theory and formal  topology are two largely equivalent ways
of studying  spaces in  terms of their  complete lattice of  open sets
rather than in terms of their  points. This has many advantages from a
constructive  point  of view.   More  information  about a  continuous
function's  behaviour can be  encoded than  if merely  considering its
action  on points. Point-free  topology seems  so far  to be  the most
successful way  of doing general topology constructively  in the sense
of Bishop's constructive  mathematics. A main goal of  our lectures is
to relate formal topology to the standard theory of metric spaces, and
show how it  also in this case improves the  notions.  We present some
recent developments.</p>
