
<p> The lectures give an  introduction to computer algebra methods for
handling  summation problems  arising in  areas like  combinatorics or
special  functions.   After  an  introductory survey,  topics  treated
include:   rational  summation,   hypergeometric   summation  (Gosper,
Zeilberger), and algorithms  for simplifying (multiple) binomial sums.
Special emphasis  is put in concrete examples.   Packages developed at
the Research  Institute for Symbolic Computation (RISC)  will be shown
in action.</p>
