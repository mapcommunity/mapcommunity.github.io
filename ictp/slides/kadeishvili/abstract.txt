
<p>The  method of  Algebraic Topology  is to  assign to  a topological
space certain algebraic models.  But stepping from complex geometrical
object to its algebraic model,  one loses part of information. That is
why  most  models are  not  complete  invariants:  the isomorphism  of
invariants does not guarantee  the equivalence of spaces.  Models with
richer algebraic structures contain  more information about the space.
For example  the invariant "cohomology  algebra" distinguishes spaces,
which can  not be distinguished by the  invariant "cohomology groups".
During the  development of Algebraic Topology many  new cohomology and
cochain  operations were invented  in order  to get  reacher algebraic
models.   The language  of  operads is  a  good tool  to handle  these
algebraic objects with huge  and complex algebraic structures. The aim
of  these  lectures is  to  present  these  structures using  operadic
technics.</p>

<p>The following  topics are  planned to discuss:  Differential graded
algebras,   bialgebras,  Lie  algebras,   cup  product   and  Steenrod
operations,  Bar   and  Cobar  constructions,   A_\infty-,  B_\infty-,
C_\infty-,  L_\infty-algebras,  differential  graded operads,  operads
defining the  above mentioned algebras,  E_\infty operads. Topological
applications:  C_\infty-algebra   structure  in  cohomology   and  the
rational  homotopy type, E_\infty-algebra  structure and  the homotopy
type.</p>
