
<p>Kadeishvilis's lecture of this Summer School is devoted to Operadic
Algebraic  Topology, the  modern  style of  Algebraic Topology,  which
simultaneously  encompasses  the  most important  current  homological
theories and also  satisfies the constructiveness requirement. Operads
are very rich algebraic  or topological structures describing the deep
homological and homotopical natures  of some object. A striking result
due to Michael  Mandell explains such a description  is complete, in a
natural sense.</p>

<p>Combinatorial  homotopy is a  necessary prerequisite  to understand
the nature of the topological  operadic theories and is the subject of
this  lecture.    Ordinary  homotopy  theory  seems   having  a  quite
topological  nature  but  it is  not  so  hard  to  describe it  in  a
combinatorial framework, and this  illustrates the power of simplicial
techniques,  the main tool  for efficient  operadic methods,  the main
tool also  for combinatorial topology  in general. It is  essential to
understand the difference between  the notion of simplicial *complex*,
elementary but  too weak  for actual applications,  and the  notion of
simplicial  *set*, much  more  complex (!),  but  very powerful.   The
audience of  this lecture could usefully  use Sections 3 and  4 of the
lecture  notes   [1]  as  an  introduction   to  this...  introductory
lecture.</p>
