

<p>1. Standard Bases and Operations on Ideals and Modules.</p>

<p>This includes  an overview on  standard bases in local,  global and
mixed rings, for  ideals and modules.  We show  algorithms for solving
the  ideal  and  submodule  membership  problem and  as  well  as  for
elimination of variables which amounts to compute the (closure) of the
image of a morphism in algebraic geometry.</p>

<p>2. Integral Closure and Constructive Normalization.</p>

<p>We  give an  algorithm to  compute the  normalization of  a reduced
affine ring (its integral closure  in the total ring of fractions) and
for computing an ideal defining the non-normal locus.</p>

<p>3. Computation in Local Rings.</p>

<p>We show how local monomial  orderings in a polynomial ring allow to
effectively  compute in  the localization  at a  maximal ideal  by the
general theory of  standard bases. We do also  address the relation to
standard bases in power series rings.</p>

<p>4. Algorithms in Singularity Theory.</p>

<p>Computations  in local  rings can  be used  to  effectively compute
important invariants  of singularities, such as the  Milnor number and
the  Tjurina number.   In more  detail we  shall treat  singular plane
algebraic curves.</p>

<p>We  assume  that  the  participants  do  have  basic  knowledge  in
commutative  algebra and algebraic  geometry.  We  shall use  the free
computer algebra  system SINGULAR (www.singular.uni-kl.de),  where all
the  presented  algorithms   have  been  implemented,  for  additional
exercises and tutorials.</p>
