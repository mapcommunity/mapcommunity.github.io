 MAP = Mathematics + Algorithms + Proofs

The MAP community consists of researchers from the now overlapping fields of certified proofs and programs, constructive mathematics, computer algebra, effective algebra (real algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, and homological algebra, ...).
This initiative started eleven in Dagstuhl (2003), when the fields were still further apart. The European ForMath project (2010 - 2013) arose from the MAP community. See the MAP Manifesto for more information about MAP.

Its website is avaiable at [https://mapcommunity.github.io](https://mapcommunity.github.io)
