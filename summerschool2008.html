    <p>These lectures will cover a wide range of topics in constructive
      real and functional analysis; they will be based primarily on the
      reference [1]. Beginning with a brief introduction to constructive
      thinking and informal intuitionistic logic, I will present an
      interval-arithmetic development of the real line, together with
      some basic real analysis. We will then deal with the constructive
      theory of metric, normed, and Hilbert spaces. This will lead us to
      the separation and Hahn-Banach theorems, which will be use to
      characterise linear functionals on the dual space and on the space
      of bounded operators on a Hilbert space. The final part of the
      analysis proper will deal with the existence of adjoints, locating
      the kernel and range of an operator, and applications of Baire's
      theorem in functional analysis. If time permits, I will discuss
      recent work on the role of Brouwer's fan theorem in analysis, part
      of a project on constructive reverse mathematics.</p>

          Algebraic Geometry"</a> </li>
    </ul>
    <p>1. Standard Bases and Operations on Ideals and Modules.</p>
    <p>This includes an overview on standard bases in local, global and
      mixed rings, for ideals and modules. We show algorithms for
      solving the ideal and submodule membership problem and as well as
      for elimination of variables which amounts to compute the
      (closure) of the image of a morphism in algebraic geometry.</p>
    <p>2. Integral Closure and Constructive Normalization.</p>
    <p>We give an algorithm to compute the normalization of a reduced
      affine ring (its integral closure in the total ring of fractions)
      and for computing an ideal defining the non-normal locus.</p>
    <p>3. Computation in Local Rings.</p>
    <p>We show how local monomial orderings in a polynomial ring allow
      to effectively compute in the localization at a maximal ideal by
      the general theory of standard bases. We do also address the
      relation to standard bases in power series rings.</p>
    <p>4. Algorithms in Singularity Theory.</p>
    <p>Computations in local rings can be used to effectively compute
      important invariants of singularities, such as the Milnor number
      and the Tjurina number. In more detail we shall treat singular
      plane algebraic curves.</p>
    <p>We assume that the participants do have basic knowledge in
      commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. We shall use the free
      computer algebra system SINGULAR (www.singular.uni-kl.de), where
      all the presented algorithms have been implemented, for additional
      exercises and tutorials.</p>

    <p>Operadic Algebraic Topology</p>

          Algebraic Topology"</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The method of Algebraic Topology is to assign to a topological
      space certain algebraic models. But stepping from complex
      geometrical object to its algebraic model, one loses part of
      information. That is why most models are not complete invariants:
      the isomorphism of invariants does not guarantee the equivalence
      of spaces. Models with richer algebraic structures contain more
      information about the space. For example the invariant "cohomology
      algebra" distinguishes spaces, which can not be distinguished by
      the invariant "cohomology groups". During the development of
      Algebraic Topology many new cohomology and cochain operations were
      invented in order to get reacher algebraic models. The language of
      operads is a good tool to handle these algebraic objects with huge
      and complex algebraic structures. The aim of these lectures is to
      present these structures using operadic technics.</p>
    <p>The following topics are planned to discuss: Differential graded
      algebras, bialgebras, Lie algebras, cup product and Steenrod
      operations, Bar and Cobar constructions, A_\infty-, B_\infty-,
      C_\infty-, L_\infty-algebras, differential graded operads, operads
      defining the above mentioned algebras, E_\infty operads.
      Topological applications: C_\infty-algebra structure in cohomology
      and the rational homotopy type, E_\infty-algebra structure and the
      homotopy type.</p>

    <p> Macaulay introducing the notion of inverse systems proposed
      duality as a strong combinatorial tool for performing ideal theory
      investigation. This series of lectures surveys the recent
      combinatorial algorithmical results stemmed from Macaulay's ideas
      and the description they offer on the structure of a 0-dimensional
      ideal:</p>
    <p>1. Moeller Algorthm and variations (FGLM, Fitzpatrick).</p>
    <p> The algorithm applies elementary linear algebra to solve, with
      good complexity, the following problem: given a finite set of
      functionals which defines a 0-dim. ideal, return its Groebner
      basis. The main applications are point evaluation, computing lex
      Groebner bases (FGLM), decoding BCM codes (Fitzpatrick).</p>
    <p>2. Cerlienco-Mureddu Algorithm, Lazard Theorem,
      Gianni--Kalkbrener Theorem.</p>
    <p> The lecture gives a survey on the main results which shed light
      on the combinatorial structure of (radical) 0-dimensional ideals.
      The lecture gives also a guideline to the readings required by the
      fourth lecture.</p>
    <p>3. Lasker--Noether Decomposition and Macaulay's Algorithm.</p>
    <p> Lasker--Noether First Theorem states that each ideal is
      decomposed into irreducible components and a lemma proves that
      irreducible components are primaries. Lasker--Noether Second
      Theorem packs together the irreducible components associated to a
      specific prime in order to produce a decomposition into primaries
      notwithstanding that, when the theorem was stated, there was
      already an explicit procedure, given by Macaualy, which allowed to
      compute the irreducible components of any given primary. The aim
      of this lecture is to explain why the notion of irreducible
      decomposition has been removed from booktexts.</p>
    <p>4. Variations on point interpolation.</p>
    <p> The students are required to read the suggested papers and to
      test the corresponding algorithms on some easy and illuminating
      examples. The aim of the last lecture is a common discussion on
      these algorithms and on their practicability.</p>
    <p> </p>

  <li> Peter Paule
    <p>Symbolic Summation (A = B)</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> The lectures give an introduction to computer algebra methods
      for handling summation problems arising in areas like
      combinatorics or special functions. After an introductory survey,
      topics treated include: rational summation, hypergeometric
      summation (Gosper, Zeilberger), and algorithms for simplifying
      (multiple) binomial sums. Special emphasis is put in concrete
      examples. Packages developed at the Research Institute for
      Symbolic Computation (RISC) will be shown in action.</p>

          Topology</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p> Locale theory and formal topology are two largely equivalent
      ways of studying spaces in terms of their complete lattice of open
      sets rather than in terms of their points. This has many
      advantages from a constructive point of view. More information
      about a continuous function's behaviour can be encoded than if
      merely considering its action on points. Point-free topology seems
      so far to be the most successful way of doing general topology
      constructively in the sense of Bishop's constructive mathematics.
      A main goal of our lectures is to relate formal topology to the
      standard theory of metric spaces, and show how it also in this
      case improves the notions. We present some recent developments.</p>
    <p> Topics covered in the lectures:</p>
    <p>1. Locales and formal topology.</p>
    <p>2. Inductively generated covers. Compactness. Separation
      properties.</p>
    <p>3. Limits and colimits in formal topology. Subspaces. Overt
      formal spaces.</p>
    <p>4. Predicativity problems in formal topology. Issues of
      formalisation.</p>
    <p>5. Localic completion of metric spaces.</p>

    <p>Introduction to Combinatorial Homotopy</p>

    <p>Kadeishvilis's lecture of this Summer School is devoted to
      Operadic Algebraic Topology, the modern style of Algebraic
      Topology, which simultaneously encompasses the most important
      current homological theories and also satisfies the
      constructiveness requirement. Operads are very rich algebraic or
      topological structures describing the deep homological and
      homotopical natures of some object. A striking result due to
      Michael Mandell explains such a description is complete, in a
      natural sense.</p>
    <p>Combinatorial homotopy is a necessary prerequisite to understand
      the nature of the topological operadic theories and is the subject
      of this lecture. Ordinary homotopy theory seems having a quite
      topological nature but it is not so hard to describe it in a
      combinatorial framework, and this illustrates the power of
      simplicial techniques, the main tool for efficient operadic
      methods, the main tool also for combinatorial topology in general.
      It is essential to understand the difference between the notion of
      simplicial *complex*, elementary but too weak for actual
      applications, and the notion of simplicial *set*, much more
      complex (!), but very powerful. The audience of this lecture could
      usefully use Sections 3 and 4 of the lecture notes [1] as an
      introduction to this... introductory lecture.</p>

    <p>In my course I will try to approach constructively the problem of
      projective modules over polynomial rings originally raised by
      J.-P. Serre in 1955.</p>
    <p>Serre remarked that it was not known whether there exist finitely
      generated projective modules over multivariate polynomial rings
      with coeffcients in a field, which are not free. This remark
      turned into the "Serre's conjecture" or "Serre's problem", stating
      that indeed there were no such modules. Proven independently by D.
      Quillen and A. A. Suslin in 1976, it became subsequently known as
      the Quillen-Suslin theorem. In my course I will give constructive
      proofs of Quillen and Suslin proofs of Serre's conjecture, simple
      and con- structive proofs of some subsequent developments in the
      theory of projective modules over polynomial rings, and also I
      will cast light on a new progress very recently obtained
      concerning the Hermite ring Conjecture.</p>
    <p>My course will be divided into four parts.</p>
    <p>1. Constructive theory of projective modules, Quillen's proof of
      Serre's conjecture, notably Quillen's patching theorem, Horrocks'
      theorem, Quillen's induction theorem.</p>
    <p>2. Suslin's proof of Serre's conjecture, a general method for
      making the use of maximal ideals constructive, the theorem of
      Traverso-Swan- Coquand about seminormality.</p>
    <p>3. Constructive theory of arithmetical rings, constructive
      compari- son between the rings R(X) and R<x> and application to
        the Lequain-Simis induction theorem, a constructive proof of the
        Lequain-Simis-Vasconcelos theorem asserting that for any
        arithmetical ring R, all finitely generated projective
        R[X1,...,Xn]-modules are extended from R.</x></p>
    <p>4. A new progress concerning the long-standing Hermite ring Con-
      jecture (1972) asserting that if R is an Hermite ring (that is,
      all finitely generated stably free R-modules are free) then so is
      R[X]. Of course, a positive solution to this conjecture will imply
      a positive solution to the famous Bass-Quillen Conjecture (1976)
      saying that for any local regular ring R, all finitely generated
      projective R[X]-modules are free. We will prove (constructively)
      that for any ring R with Krull dimension &lt; 2, R[X] is an
      Hermite ring. Moreover, the corresponding completion of unimodular
      rows can be done using elementary matrices (instead of invertible
      matrices). In other words, we will prove that for any ring R with
      Krull dimension &lt; 2 and n &gt; 2, any unimodular vector in
      R[X]^n can be completed into an elementary matrice in R[X]^(nxn).
      We will also discuss possible generalizations of this result and
      some new open questions that it raises.</p>
