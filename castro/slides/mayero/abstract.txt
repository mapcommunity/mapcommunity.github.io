(Joint work with David Delahaye)

We propose a decision procedure for algebraically closed fields based on a
quantifier elimination method. The procedure is intended to build proofs for
systems of polynomial equations and inequations. We describe how this
procedure can be carried out in a proof assistant using a Computer Algebra 
system in a purely skeptical way. We present an implementation in the 
particular framework of Coq and Maple giving some details regarding the 
interface between the two tools. This allows us to show that a Computer
Algebra system can be used not only to bring additional computational power to 
a proof assistant but also to enhance the automation of such tools.
