Our main aim with this talk is to introduce a dynamic constructive Galois Theory which
allows us to obtain a representation of the splitting field of a separable polynomial over a field. 
We present some methods which are giving a constructive substitute for the classical 
splitting field, which does not work when there is no factorization algorithm. 
With our methodology, we're trying to combine the dynamic evaluation
techniques (D5) introduced by Della Dora, Dicrescenzo and Duval with the fantastic Galois theory.
