
Abstracts of F. Sergeraert's Castro-Urdiales talks.

A tutorial about "Constructive Algegraic Topology" was required.
The subject has been naturally divided into four parts.

Castro-1: Combinatorial  Topology.  The standard  simplicial complexes
  are not enough for good algebraic topology, the so-called simplicial
  *sets* are necessary. Castro-1  is an expository presentation of the
  subject with the simplest examples. For serious references, question
  Google  with  "Peter May  simplicial  objects"  and "Goerss  Jardine
  simplicial theory".

Castro-2.   Homological  algebra.  Devoted  to  *one* typical  example
  explaining why  standard homological algebra is  not effective.  The
  best  reference  for  elementary  homological  algebra  probably  is
  MacLane, "Homological Algebra".  The talk terminates with the subtle
  definitions of effective chain complexes and locally effective chain
  complexes.

Castro-3. Effective  homology. Combining the notions  of effective and
  locally   effective  chain  complexes,   and  the   so-called  Basic
  Perturbation Lemma,  an easy and efficient solution  is obtained for
  Constructive Algebraic topology. The simple example of the effective
  homology version of  the Serre spectral sequence is  used.  See also
  Google(Rubio  Sergeraert  Bulletin)  in  which  other  more  precise
  references can be obtained.

Castro-4.   An  informal exposition  about  the  hard but  interesting
  problems  which are met  when the  theoretical methods  of effective
  homology  are to  be  *concretely* implemented  on  a computer.  The
  programming  context is  quite new  and leads  to  numerous exciting
  problems.
