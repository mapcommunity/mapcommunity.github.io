Spectral Sequences are a useful tool in Algebraic Topology providing information on homology groups by successive approximations from the homology of appropriate associated complexes. However, they are not real algorithms except in exceptional cases. On the contrary, the effective homology method provides a real algorithm for the computation of homology groups of complicated spaces. In this poster, we explain how the effective homology method can also be used for the computation of spectral sequences. A set of programs has been developed, allowing the user to calculate the whole set of components of spectral sequences associated to filtered complexes.
