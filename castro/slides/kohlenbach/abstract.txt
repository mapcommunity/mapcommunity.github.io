In recent years (though influenced by papers of G. Kreisel going back 
to the 50's) 
an applied form of proof theory systematically evolved which sometimes 
is called `Proof Mining'. 
A particularly fruitful area of applications of proof theory in mathematics 
has been numerical and nonlinear functional analysis. 
This 4-part course gives a survey on the logical 
foundations of this approach and its applications in analysis.
