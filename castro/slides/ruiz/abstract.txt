In this conference we present our experience using the ACL2 system to verify
computer algebra. First we give a short introduction to the formal
verification of programs and the use of theorem provers as a tool for this
task. Then, we present a short overview to the ACL2 system, used by our
reserch group in Seville to carry out formal verification, and we try to
motivate why we think it is suitable for formal verification of symbolic
computation systems. Finally we show an example: the formal proof in ACL2 of
Dickson's lemma, in the context of the development of a formally verified
Common Lisp implementation of Buchberger algorithm.
