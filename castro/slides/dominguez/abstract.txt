Abstract

The aim of this work is to describe the current state of an ongoing
project to formalize, within the framework of diagrammatic logic
(due to Dominique Duval and Christian Lair) some data structures
appearing in Sergeraert's symbolic computation systems Kenzo and
EAT. In a previous work, we gave some hints on the reason why a
key construction (called imp construction) in the specification
of the systems can be understood as a freely generating functor
between suitable categories of diagrammatic realizations. Now, we
will focus on the new  open lines, giving a few details on the
problems we have encountered up to now.
