Title : Program Extraction from Normalization Proofs

Abstract: We formalize the standard proof (using computability
predicates) of the existence of normal forms for terms of the simply
typed lambda-calculus.  Then we machine-extract a program from this
proof, which turns out to implement the well-known normalization by
evaluation algorithm.
