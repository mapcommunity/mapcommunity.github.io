Symbolic Computation of A_\infty-structures:
(Abstract)

In the framework of Effective Algebraic Topology, we are interested in the computation 
of A-infinity structures.

In this poster, we would like to show wich type of pitfalls we had to solve.

Thanks to the basic perturbation lemma and the tensor trick, from theorical 
viewpoint it is possible to obtain the morphisms involved in such structures 
 with the help of a computer.

But the problems appear when we translate this mathematical notion to computational world. 

For short, only two specific problems are explained in this poster: how to solve infinite loops and 
the extension of class family!
