It is folklore that if a continuous equation has approximate solutions
and - in a quantitative manner - at most one solution, then it has a
(of course, uniquely determined) exact solution. I first review the
standard ways to validate this heuristic principle both in classical
mathematics and in constructive mathematics with countable choice, and
then indicate how this can be carried over to the choice-free way of
doing completions put forward by Mulvey, Stolzenberg, Richman, et
al. Moreover, I sketch how the crucial "at most one" hypothesis can be
obtained, by invoking Brouwer's fan theorem, from appropriate preconditions 
of a qualitative nature. In fact, the fan theorem is equivalent to the 
general validity of the implication from the qualitative to the quantitative uniqueness condition for continuous functions on a compact metric space.
