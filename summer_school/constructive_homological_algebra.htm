		<td class="body"><p align="justify">Standard homological algebra is not constructive, and this is
frequently the source of serious problems when algorithms are
looked for. In particular the usual exact and spectral sequences
of homological algebra frequently are not sufficient to obtain
some unknown homology or homotopy group. We will explain it is
not difficult to fill in this gap, the main tools being on one
hand, from a mathematical point of view, the so-called
Homological Perturbation Lemma, and on the other hand, from a
computational point of view, Functional Programming.<br>
We will illustrate this area of constructive mathematics by
applications in two domains:<br>
a) Commutative Algebra frequently meets homological objects, in
particular when resolutions are involved (syzygies).<br>
Constructive Homological Algebra produces new methods to process
old problems such as homology of Koszul complexes, resolutions,
minimal resolutions. The solutions so obtained are constructive
and therefore more complete thant the usual ones, an important
point for their concrete use.<br>
b) Algebraic Topology is the historical origin of Homological
Algebra. The usual exact and spectral sequences of Algebraic
Topology can be easily transformed into new effective versions,
giving algorithms computing for example unknown homology and
homotopy groups. In particular the effective version of the
Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence gives a very simple solution
for the old Adams' problem: what algorithm could compute the
homology groups of iterated loop spaces?<br>
Machine programs and machine demonstrations will also
concretely illustrate the theoretical results so obtained.<br>
Plan:<br>
1. Elements of Homological Algebra. Ordinary Homological Algebra
is not constructive.<br>
2. Notion of (constructive) "Solution of the Homological Problem
for a chain-complex". Reductions between chain-complexes.
Homological Perturbation Lemma. Particular case of twisted sums
(cone construction).<br>
3. Applications in Commutative Algebra: Effective Homology of
Koszul complexes. Equivalence between *effective* homology of
Koszul complexes and resolutions. A simple solution for a
minimal resolution.<br>
4. Twisted products in Algebraic Topology. The effective version
of the Serre spectral sequence. Application: a theoretical and
concrete algorithm computing homotopy groups.<br>
5. Twisted divisions in Algebraic Topology. The effective
version of the Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence. Application: a
theoretical and concrete algorithm solving Adams' problem for
iterated loop spaces.<br>
6. Effective Algebraic Topology and Postnikov invariants.
Conclusion: the pretended Postnikov invariants in fact are
not... invariant!</p></td>
