The MFPS conferences are devoted to those areas of mathematics, logic
and computer science which are related to the semantics of programming
languages. The series particularly has stressed providing a forum
where both mathematicians and computer scientists can meet and
exchange ideas about problems of common interest. We also encourage
participation by researchers in neighboring areas, since we strive to
maintain breadth in the scope of the series.
