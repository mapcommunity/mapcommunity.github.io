There are direct flights to the airport of Genova
<a class="lbody" target="blank_" href="http://www.aeroportodigenova.com/en/home/index.php">Cristoforo Colombo</a>
from Roma Fiumicino, Milano Malpensa, Amsterdam, London Stansted (by Ryan Air), Paris CDG, and
Munich.
<br/><br/>
The airport is located in Sestri Ponente, one of the boroughs of
Genoa, some 6 km (4 miles) from the center of the town.
The local bus company AMT runs the bus service 100 
<b>Volabus</b> to (and from) the  centre of town and piazza Verdi, in front of
the  train station <b>Genova Brignole</b>.
It runs every half an hour.<br/><br/>
Other airports near Genoa are Milano Malpensa, Torino, Nice (France),
Pisa. There are reasonable train connections from each of these
airports to Genoa.<br/>
The easiest train connection is from Pisa since
there is a train station at the airport on a main line (requires one
change in Pisa Centrale). <br/>
Milano Malpensa, the largest airport in
Italy, has a direct, 40 minute train connection to Milano, but the
final destination of those trains from the airport is the station of
Milano Cadorna, and one must go from that station to Milano Centrale
(by underground, taxi or bus) to catch a train to Genova.<br/>
As already mentioned, there are also flight from Milano Malpensa to
Genova.
