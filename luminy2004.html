This meeting is the continuation of the
seminar "Verification and constructive algebra"
held in Dagstuhl from 6 to 10 january 2003.

<p>The goal of the meeting is to bring together people from the
communities of formal proofs, constructive mathematics and
computer algebra (in a wide meaning).

<p>One objective of the meeting is to bridge the gap between
conceptual (abstract) and computational (constructive)
mathematics, by providing a computational understanding
of abstract mathematics.

<p>It is becoming clear that many parts of abstract mathematics
can be made constructive and even computational and that
abstract mathematics techniques contains an underlying
constructive content.

<p>We are not only interested in algorithms however, but also
in formal proofs of the correctness of these algorithms.

<p>Computer algebra provides a variety of interesting basic
algorithms, from exact linear algebra to various aspects of
elimination and real root counting, which are the
foundations for much more sophisticated results
like nullstellensatz, quantifier elimination etc...
It is remarkable that in constructive and computer algebra,
progress in sophisticated algorithms often implies progress
on basics.

<p>Moreover the scope of computer algebra is now widened by the
consideration of seminumerical algorithms. When such
algorithms are correctly controlled, they actually deal with
real and complex numbers in the constructive meaning of
these objects.
So computer algebra is lead to fill many objectives of
computational analysis.

<p>Providing formal proofs of correctness to the computer
algebra community is very useful, specially for algorithms
which are basic and used everywhere.

<p>On the other hand, a collection of mathematically non
trivial examples  is very useful for the formal proof
community, which needs also powerful automatic methods from
computer algebra.

<p>We observe that the  Dagstuhl seminar 03021/1, which seems
to have been the first meeting devoted to the topic,  was a
success and has been very satisfactory for the participants.
They decided to create a  group  under the acronym

<p class="centered">"Mathematics, Algorithms, Proofs"</p>

<p>and asked us to organize a similar meeting on january 2004.</p>

<h4>Convenient Reasoning about Substructures &#8212; Towards
Instantiation of Locales</h4>

<a class="sobre" href="luminy/slides/ballarin.pdf">[slides]</a>
<p>
<p> 
Locales provide means to manage hierarchical specifications
in the Isabelle theorem prover, together with contexts of facts (that
is, consequences derived from the specifications).  Currently, locales
only support reasoning in contexts where locale specifications are
directly present &#8212; for example, if the context includes the
specification "group" then all facts about groups are visible.  If
the context contains a specification importing another specification,
then the latter facts are also available in the context &#8212; for
example, a context including the specification "commutative group"
contains all facts about both groups and commutative groups, provided
"commutative groups" imports "groups".

<p>
Facts are not available in contexts where specifications are not
explicitly included, even if the specification is a consequence of
other specifications or assumptions present in that context.  Facts
are neither available in a context containing an object that happens
to meet a specification.  Of course, it is possible, after showing
that an object meets a specification, to instantiate facts manually.
However, since specifications are hierarchic, this may involve
additional reasoning, which is both tedious and clutters up proof
scripts.  We discuss an extention to locales that makes this
instantiation automatic and easy to use.  The extension is intended to
make reasoning about subgroups in Isabelle as elegant as many informal
proofs by exploiting that subgroups form a lattice.

<h4>An intuitionistic model of Arithmetical Maps</h4> 

<a class="sobre" href="luminy/slides/berardi.pdf">[slides]</a>
<p>

We propose a purely intuitionistic equational model <IMG WIDTH="31"
HEIGHT="17"  SRC="luminy/img1.gif" ALT="$N*$"> of
arithmetical maps on integers.  <IMG WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="17"
 SRC="luminy/img1.gif" ALT="$N*$"> is an
<I>informative</I> model: if <!-- MATH $\exists x.P(x)$ --> <IMG
WIDTH="71" HEIGHT="37" class="middle" SRC="luminy/img2.gif"
ALT="$\exists x.P(x)$"> is true in <IMG WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="17"
  SRC="luminy/img1.gif" ALT="$N*$">, we may
intuitionistically deduce <IMG WIDTH="45" HEIGHT="37" class="middle"
 SRC="luminy/img3.gif" ALT="$P(n)$"> for some integer <IMG
WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="17"   SRC="luminy/img4.gif"
ALT="$n$">.  There is an universal arrow <!-- MATH $Ext: \rightarrow
N*$ --> <IMG WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="18"  
SRC="luminy/img5.gif" ALT="$Ext: \rightarrow N*$">.  As a consequence,
integers are a dense subset <IMG WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="17" 
 SRC="luminy/img6.gif" ALT="$N$"> of <IMG WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="17"
  SRC="luminy/img1.gif" ALT="$N*$">: if a property of
the structure <IMG WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="17"  
SRC="luminy/img1.gif" ALT="$N*$"> is true for all <IMG WIDTH="56" HEIGHT="34"
class="middle"  SRC="luminy/img7.gif" ALT="$x \in N$">, then it is
true for all <IMG WIDTH="56" HEIGHT="34" class="middle" 
SRC="luminy/img7.gif" ALT="$x \in N$">. <IMG WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="17"
  SRC="luminy/img1.gif" ALT="$N*$"> is not obtained
through Non-counterexample interpretation, nor through any existing
proof-theoretical technique: instead of translating classical proofs
into intuitionistic ones, we define a model directly validating
Excluded Middle over one-quantifier formulas.

<P>
We had several motivations in introducing <IMG WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="17"
  SRC="luminy/img1.gif" ALT="$N*$">:

<ul>
<li>
A motivation from Recursion Theory: finding a recursive model of
arithmetical maps, in order to use them in real programming.
<li>
A motivation from the study of Parallelism: we intend to show that
a model of arithmetical maps may be more efficiently described
using parallel asynchronous non-deterministic computations.
<li>
An "ontological" motivation: trying to describe what non-recursive
maps <i>are</i>, from a constructive viewpoint. Our thesis is
that non-recursive maps are recursive maps over some suitable
intuitionistic topological completion of the integer line. The
elements of such completion are processes able to "learn", as
suggested by Hayashi
</ul>

<h3>Ulrich BERGER</h3>

<h4>A computational interpretation of classical analysis</h4>


<p>
We study the proof-theoretic and computational properties of the
principle of open induction, a reformulation of Nash-Williams'
minimal-bad-sequence argument. It is well-know that open induction is
classically equivalent to (countable) dependent choice. We show that
intuitonistically, the two principles are quite different: Unlike
dependent choice, open induction is closed under negative- and
A-translation, and hence proves the same Pi02-formulas in classical or
intuitionistic arithmetic.  We also give a modified realizability
interpretation of open induction and obtain in this way a method for
extracting programs from classical proofs of Pi02-formulas using open
induction (or dependent choice).  The computational interpretations of
classical countable choice and classical dependent choice derived from
our method are essentially the same as the interpretations given by
Berardi, Bezem and Coquand and provide a new proof-theoretic
explanation of their results.


<h3>Sylvie  BOLDO</h3>

<h4>Formal proofs about computer arithmetic:
                        some faithful results</h4>

<a class="sobre" href="luminy/slides/boldo.pdf">[slides]</a>
<p>
I will present our latest results about polynomial evaluation in order
to compute elementary functions.  Common knowledge is that Horner's
rule is a good scheme unless the indeterminate is close to one of the
polynomial's roots.  We propose here criteria for one step of Horner's
scheme to be faithful. All the results were formally checked with our
Coq floating-point formalization. I will then present some
perspectives and debatable questions&nbsp;: how to complete our
implementation into the IEEE-754 standard (exceptions, traps, vectors
of bits...)&nbsp;? How to handle other systems&nbsp;?


<h3>Thierry COQUAND        </h3>

<h4>Dynamical Methods in Algebra</h4>

<p>
<a class="sobre" href="luminy/slides/coquand.pdf">[slides]</a>
<p>
The notion of dynamical proofs [2] leads to constructive versions of
some classical abstract algebraic results whose proofs involve Zorn's
lemma.  This approach allows to reason constructively about structures
that often can be shown -not- to exist effectively, like the algebraic
closure of an arbitrary field.  I will try to survey this approach,
explaining the connections and differences with Kronecker's approach
to algebra. There are also strong connections with point-free topology
[1] (for the description, for instance of the Zariski spectrum), with
geometric logic, but also with the method D5 [3] introduced in
computer algebra.

<h3>Gilles DOWEK    </h3>

<h4>Confluence as a cut elimination property
                        (invited talk)</h4>

<a class="sobre" href="luminy/slides/dowek.ps">[slides]</a>
<p>
The goal of this talk is to compare two notions, one coming from the
theory of rewrite systems and the other from proof theory: confluence
and cut elimination.  We show that to each rewrite system on terms, we
can associate a logical system: asymmetric deduction modulo this
rewrite system and that the confluence property of the rewrite system
is equivalent to the cut elimination property of the associated
logical system.  This equivalence, however, does not extend to rewrite
systems directly rewriting atomic propositions.

<h3>Dominique DUVAL </h3>

<h4>Diagrammatic specifications</h4>
<a class="sobre" href="luminy/slides/duval.pdf">[slides]</a>
<p>
Diagrammatic specifications are defined and several examples are
presented, including overloaded specifications.


<h3>Silvia GEBELLATO       </h3>

<h4>The basic picture as invariance under transfer
                        along a relation</h4>
(joint work with G. Sambin)


<p>The basic picture is the theory originated from basic pairs, that is
binary relations between two sets, and from relation-pairs, that is
commutative squares with a notion of equality. It started a new
constructive approach to topology based on symmetry between pointwise
and pointfree notions, and logical duality between open and
closed subsets.

<p>
In this talk an abstract characterization of the basic picture will be
presented, which let us to describe the pointfree notions of open and
closed subsets as the outcome of transferring the structure of the
category of subsets along a (continuous) relation.

<p>
The starting point which made this characterization possible was the
systematic use of a new relation between subsets, besides inclusion, which
expresses the fact that two subsets have a common element abstractly and
in a positive way. This relation, introduced by G. Sambin, has been called "overlap".

<p>
By means of overlap, a structural method characterizing relations
between sets has been developed and enabled us to describe the
basic picture as a structure invariant under continuous relations.


<h3>Herman GEUVERS</h3>

<h4>CCoRN, the Constructive Coq Repository at Nijmegen</h4>

<p>
At Nijmegen we have created a repository of formalised constructive
mathematics in the proof assistant Coq. This grew out of a
constructive formalization of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
(FTA), where a lot of basic algebra and analysis was alraedy
formalized. The goal of CCoRN (and also the FTA formalization) is not
so much to prove impressive mathematical theorems but to create a
basis repository of formalized mathematics in which people can prove
their own (impressive) mathematical theorems.

<p>
Important issues are: documentation, notation and automation.  In the
talk I will describe the contents of CCoRN, its (short) history and
the guidelines that we (try to) keep for our developments. Furthermore
I will speak about the (possible) (dis)advantages of working
constructively and the "missing parts" of CCoRN.


<h3>Dima GRIGORIEV         </h3>

<h4>Factoring and solving linear partial differential equations</h4>

<p>
The problem of factoring a linear partial differential operator is
studied. An algorithm is designed which allows one to factor an operator
when its symbol is separable, and if in addition the operator has enough
right factors then it is completely reducible. Since finding the space of
solutions of a completely reducible operator reduces to the same for its
right factors, we apply this approach and execute a complete analysis of
factoring and solving a second-order operator in two independent
variables. Some results on factoring third-order operators are exhibited.


<h3>Assia MAHBOUBI</h3>

<h4>Induction over real numbers</h4>

<a class="sobre" href="luminy/slides/mahboubi.pdf">[slides]</a>
<p>
We have a constructive look at a quite elementary lemma of standard
real analysis which can be considered as an &laquo;&nbsp;open
induction principle&nbsp;&raquo;. Following an idea of Th. Coquand,
who has prouved the result for the dyadic Cantor set, we provide a new
constructive proof also using monotone bar induction. This latter
proof works directly with the real numbers and an appropriate kind of
real open sets.  The computational content of such an induction
principle over real numbers is quite easy to extract but it would be
rather interesting to understand its status in the hierarchy of
non-classical axioms.


<h3>Milad NIQUI</h3>

<h4>Exact Real Arithmetic using Coinductive Types</h4>

<p>
The aim of this talk is to show the relationship between admissibility
(a topological property) of real number representations, and
productivity (a type theoretic property) of the algorithms for exact
real arithmetic. In order to show this relationship we discuss the
Potts' approach to exact real arithmetic which is based on a
normalisation algorithm on a coinductive type of expression trees. We
consider formalisation of these notions in type theory and we discuss
how changes in representation for real numbers can affect the
coinductive nature of the proofs in type theory.

<h3>Steven OBUA</h3>

<h4>Towards a Machine-Checked Proof of the Kepler Conjecture</h4>

<p>
The Kepler Conjecture was proven in 1998 by Thomas Hales. The Flyspeck
project is about formalizing his proof.  First an overview is given
over what the Kepler Conjecture is all about, and for a better
understanding its analogy in two dimensions is discussed. Then the
proof given by Thomas Hales will be sketched. Then some of the first
steps taken in the Flyspeck project are outlined.



<h3>Paulo OLIVA</h3>

<h4>Bounded Functional Interpretation</h4>

<a class="sobre" href="luminy/slides/oliva.pdf">[slides]</a>
<p>
In this talk I will present a version of Goedel's functional
interpretation which is insensitive to bounded quantifiers. The
interpretation makes fundamental use of the majorizability relation
(due to Howard/Bezem) in order to extend the notion of "bound" to all
finite types. I will first present the original motivation for the
work and the basic framework for defining the interpretation. In the
second part of the talk, we shall see applications of the
interpretation to (classical) proofs which involve ineffective
principles such as weak Koenig's lemma.  All the results in the talk
were obtained in collaboration with Professor Fernando Ferreira, from
Lisbon University.

<h4>Computer-Assisted Proving and Finding in Combinatorics
                        and Special Functions (invited talk)</h4>

<p>

I start with supplementing the MAP-club manifesto by a picture of
Buchberger's creativity spiral describing the process of mathematical
discovery.  The talk discusses concrete examples where an interplay of
algorithmic experimental mathematics and the activity of proving has
led to the discovery of new theorems.  The examples are taken from
partition analysis, a computational method created by MacMahon for
combinatorial problem solving about hundred years ago. In a research
project joint with G.E. Andrews (PennState) and A. Riese (RISC-Linz)
MacMahon's method has been translated into a computer algebra
algorithm. Applications range from finding nonnegative integer
solutions of linear systems of Diophantine inequalities and equations,
to computing generating functions for number partitions defined over
various posets.

<h3>Herv&eacute; PERDRY</h3>

<h4>Strongly Noetherian rings and Lasker-Noether rings </h4>

<a class="sobre" href="luminy/perdry/perdry.pdf">[slides]</a>

<p>
We give a new constructive definition for Noetherian rings. It has a
very concrete statement and is nevertheless strong enough to prove
constructively the termination of algorithms involving "trees of
ideals".
<p>
The efficiency of such algorithms (at least for providing clear and
intuitive constructive proofs) is illustrated by a constructive
approach to classical topics from ideal theory: we give constructive
proofs for the existence of the minimal primes over an ideal, of its
radical (intersection of finitely many primes), of its primary
decomposition, in a wide class of polynomial rings, the Lasker-Noether
rings.

<h4>The Foc distribution</h4>

<a class="sobre" href="luminy/slides/rioboo.ps">[slides]</a>
<p>
This talk presents the basics of the next release of the FoC
distribution. After a recall of the FoC programming language and its
concepts, we present some tools that enable a FoC programmer to
document hist code. In the same spirit than JavaDoc or Doxygen
structured comments are added by the programmer in order to have them
included in the documentation. FoCDoC has the advantage over existing
tools for other programming languages that rendering is achieved using
the MathML W3C norm and is viewable by most of the recent Web
browsers.


<h3>Julio RUBIO</h3>

<h4>Emulating proof-by-hand with Isabelle</h4>

<a class="sobre" href="luminy/slides/rubio.ppt">[slides]</a>
<p>
In the talk, we will report on the state of a project devoted to give
a mechanised proof of the Basic Perturbation Lemma (or BPL, in
short). The BPL is a central result in algorithmic homological
algebra, and has been intensively used in the development of the Kenzo
system (a Common Lisp program designed by Sergeraert for computations
in Algebraic Topology).  Thus, to get a mechanised proof of the BPL
seems a necessary step towards certified versions of the algorithms
appearing in Kenzo.
<p>
We will argue that to reach this objective, it is convenient to
emulate in a proof assistant (Isabelle, in our case) the very essence
of a concrete proof-by-hand. We illustrate the role of abstraction in
mechanised reasoning (not so different from its use in other
computer-based mathematics, as symbolic computation), by means of
simple examples. The abstraction level is constrained by contextual
knowledge, in our case by the need of having computational content in
the proof objects.
<p>
Then, these general ideas are particularised to a specific lemma in
the proof of the BPL.

<h4>Putting predicative topology in algebraic terms</h4>

<p>
An intuitionistic and predicative approach to topology has pulled out
a whole structure which I have called the Basic Picture. It is based
on symmetries and logical dualities, and gives both usual and
pointfree (or formal) topology as a special case, when a notion of
convergence is added. The main novelty with respect to standard
topology is the use of mathematical notions corresponding to
existential statements.
<p>
In this talk I will introduce the notion of S-algebra, a natural
algebraic axiomatization of the notion of powerset in which the notion
of overlap of two subsets ("there exists a point belonging to both
subsets") is taken as primitive.  By suppressing overlap, one gets
back the notion of complete Heyting algebra, or frame. The additional
expressive power provided by overlap is considerable: I will show that
the language of S-algebras is strong enough to be able to develop the
whole basic picture and formal topology in algebraic terms.  Thus
S-algebras appear as the correct algebraic structures to deal
abstractly with the computational contents of topology.


<h3>Carsten SCHNEIDER </h3>

<h4>  Proving and Finding Multisum Identities in
  Difference Fields</h4>

<a class="sobre" href="luminy/slides/schneider.ps">[slides]</a>
<p>
Sigma is a summation package, implemented in the computer algebra
system Mathematica, that enables to discover and prove nested
multisum identities. Based on Karr's difference field theory
(1981) this package allows to find all solutions of parameterized
linear difference equations in a very general difference field
setting, so called Pi-Sigma-fields. Starting from these summation
algorithms I will present a more general framework that enables to
deal with summation problems which involve objects that can be
described by a linear recurrence, like orthogonal polynomials.
<p>
All these aspects will be illustrated by proving the celebrated
Totally Symmetric Plane Partition Theorem (Stembridge, 1995) with
computer algebra methods. Special emphasize is put on the
verification of these proofs.


<h3>Peter SCHUSTER</h3>

<h4>Why Formal Geometry, and How?
  (invited talk)</h4>

<p>
<p>
Formal geometry is abstract algebraic geometry done in an elementary
point-free way inspired by formal topology. Every move is avoided
that would affect any computational information contained in the
initial data. We try to give a flavour of the tentative practice.


<h3>Helmut SCHWICHTENBERG</h3>

<h4>Program Extraction in Constructive Analysis</h4>

<a class="sobre" href="luminy/slides/schwichtenberg.pdf">[slides]</a>
<p>
We are interested in exact real numbers, as opposed to floating point
numbers.  The final goal is to develop the basics of real analysis in
such a way that from a proof of an existence formula one can extract a
program.  For instance, from a proof of the intermediate value theorem
we want to extract a program that, given an arbitrary error bound
<i>2<sup>-k</sup></i>, computes a rational <i>x</i> where the given
function is zero up to the error bound.  - The novel aspect of the
present work is the development of elementary constructive analysis in
such a way that witnesses have as low a type level as possible.  This
clearly is important for the complexity of the extracted programs.


<h3>Francis SERGERAERT</h3>

<h4>The status of Postnikov invariants in algebraic topology</h4>

<a class="sobre" href="luminy/slides/sergeraert.ps">[slides]</a>
<p>
The computability problem about  the Postnikov complexes is solved and
the  next natural  computability  problem in  algebraic topology,  the
<i>isomorphism   problem</i>  between   two  Postnikov   towers,  once
translated  into  the  standard   algebraic  framework,  leads  to  an
algebraic decision problem  which has its own interest,  the nature of
which being  <i>arithmetical</i>.  Because  of the negative  answer by
Matiyasevich to  Hilbert's tenth problem, maybe  we are in  front of a
new surprising kind of incompleteness in Algebraic Topology.  The talk
is devoted to  a description as simple as  possible of this situation,
to explain how the statement of the correspondant algebraic problem is
obtained.  We  thus obtain a  general decision problem  in arithmetic,
the  solution  of  which  is  crucial in  simply  connected  algebraic
topology.
<p>
More generally the <i>computability status</i> of the Postnikov towers
is really fantastic.  The definition  of a Postnikov tower contains in
particular some "invariants'';  it is explained in the  talk why this
terminology  is  erroneous: the  nature  of  an  equality relation  is
misunderstood.  Transforming   these  pseudo-invariants  into  correct
invariants is the computability  problem we are interested in; because
of Matiyasevich,  it is even  not clear a <i>positive</i>  solution of
this problem exists.

<h4>Constructive Algebraic Integration Theory without Choice</h4>

<p>
In this talk I'll present a constructive development of integration
algebras in the sense of Segal. Using point-free topology, a Stone
representation theorem for these algebras will be obtained and applied
to the group algebra of a compact group. Thus we obtain a point-free
description of the space of characters. Using countable choice and a
positivity predicate we can then construct all the characters. In this
way we obtain an elementary and apparently new proof of the Peter-Weyl
theorem.  It appears that this is the first *mathematical* application
of a positivity predicate.
<p>
Finally, we compare this approach to Richman's choice-free
constructive mathematics using Brouwer's spreads.
