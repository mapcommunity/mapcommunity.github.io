     <h2>Manifesto</h2>
     
      <p> Writing a text which could reasonably be considered as a MAP manifesto
        is an interesting subject by itself. This is only a pre-first tentative
        draft. </p>
      <p> The title of the Dagstuhl meeting was "Verification and Constructive
        Algebra", and it is amusing to note that the intersection, from the
        strict point of view of words, between this title and MAP is empty.
        Which was striking at Dagstuhl was on one hand the plurality of subjects
        studied by the participants and on the other hand a deep and subtle
        unity of *style* in the very nature of the various breakthroughs which
        were reported. </p>
      <p> It is suspected that the order of the letters M-A-P is only due to the
        general rule applied when acronyms are looked for: trying to find a word
        meaning something. Nevertheless the word "Mathematics" is probably more
        *generic*, only in a vague sense, than both others. It can be reasonably
        considered that algorithms and proofs are some components of
        mathematics. So that the members of the MAP club are firstly
        *mathematicians*. </p>
      <p> However one of the major results obtained by Hilbert creating the
        axiomatic organization of mathematics is that in a sense the process can
        be reversed. The whole domain of mathematics might be formalized, and
        such an organization amounts on the contrary to consider that
        algorithmic and logic constitute more primitive subjects than
        mathematics. This amazing duality is now well known by the lucid
        mathematicians, and certainly the Dagsuhl participants were of this
        sort. </p>
      <p> Maybe the common kernel of the Dagstuhl participants' style is
        precisely that they are much more than ordinary mathematicians aware of
        the fantastic richness of the various interconnections between those
        three subjects, mathematics, algorithms and proofs, and they hope -- and
        obtain -- new insights into these domains by studying more carefully,
        more deeply these interconnections. </p>
      <p> Standard mathematics can sometimes be used to deduce from some
        computing results new mathematical results. This often amounts to
        produce a certificate for an algorithm, transforming a computing result
        into a mathematical proof of a result produced by a computer. After all,
        this could be modelized as a... mapping M + A -&gt; P. The four colours
        theorem has be obtained in this way. </p>
      <p> Other times, mathematics or more precisely logic can be used to
        produce proofs *and* algorithms extracted from proofs. M -&gt; P -&gt;
        A. The whole field covered by constructive mathematics can be described
        in this way. The constructive point of view sometimes leads to new
        perspectives in some quite "classical" theories, leading to original
        methods, frequently easier to be understood, simply because they are
        closer to the material truth; quickly giving efficient algorithms; it's
        a case of a map M -&gt; A. But when the algorithms begin to give new
        results, it is important to prove them to certify the results so
        obtained; in other words M -&gt; A must be completed in M -&gt; A + P. </p>
      <p> And so on. This presentation is somehow superficial and more serious
        constructions modelizing and/or formalizing the various interconnections
        between mathematics, algorithms and proofs are the heart of the
        numberous books following the wonderful work about fundamental
        mathematics due to Hilbert, Brouwer, GÃ¶del, Heyting, Church, Turing,
        Markov, Post and so many others. </p>
      <hr>
      <p> More concretely, the MAP club intends to put together various means
        which could help to organize more systematically meetings about these
        questions. The participants are expected to be on watch to detect every
        organization which might be used from this point of view. The European
        financial sources must in particular be seriously studied. </p>
      <p>This manifesto (due to Francis Sergeraert) is still work in progress.
        We're waiting for comments on the MAP mailing list.</p>
